Folder containing scripts used to prepare data and print figures related to the comparisons between the frequency of water limitation estimated from GRACE vs other alternative GRACE-based products (i.e. GLWS and GLDAS). 

Execute in order. Scripts starting with "-expl" will produce exploratory figures only used in the replies to referees. 
"save_summary_merged_GRACE.R" produce an intermediary file used to process GLWS and GLDAS data and plot Fig. S2.
