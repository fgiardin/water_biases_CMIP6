Folder containing scripts to generate all figures present in the main text. Each script produces a figure. 
The subfolder 'SI' contains scripts to plot all figures present in the Supplementary Information. 

* **Fig_1_water_limitation.R**: script to plot Fig. 1 "Global maps of frequency of water limitation" and Fig. S3. 

* **Fig_2_IPCCregions_water_lim_MMean.R**: script to plot Fig. 2 "Comparison of the frequency of water limitation across different IPCC regions based on LMIP-CMIP6 model simulations and observations". 

* **Fig_3_fluxnet_comparison.R**: script to plot Fig. 3 "Analysis of water limitation at three selected eddy-covariance sites". 

* **Fig_4_CWD_ALEXI_MMean_hist.R**: script to plot Fig. 4 "Comparison of active land water storage capacity (ALWSC) from LMIP-CMIP6 simulations against observations-based estimates" and Fig. S7.
